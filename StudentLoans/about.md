# Student Loan Data Analysis

This project is an analysis of **United States student loan information**. The data we used was​ collected​ ​by​ ​ the Office​ ​of​ ​Federal​ ​ Student​ ​Aid​ (OFSA)​ ​and can be found [here](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/national-student-loan-data-system).

Our​ ​audience​ wants​ to​ ​ learn​ what​​ types of​ ​loans​ ​are​ available,​ and​ how​ ​ much​ money​ ​is often​ ​ allocated​ ​to​ each​ type​ ​ of​ loan.​ This​ can​ ​give​ ​ the​ ​audience​ ​insight​​ on​ ​what​ ​type​ of​ ​loan​ ​they
may​ qualify​ ​for​ ​or​ ​what​ ​type​ ​of​ loan​ ​they​ ​are most​​ likely​ ​ to​ ​ receive.

With our data, we hope to answer 3 main questions based solely on the total amount of loans distributed:

1. How has debt increased for students from 2013 to the present?

2. In what year has the amount of debt per person been the highest?

3. Which loan type makes up the most of the total amount of outstanding dollars?


As​ ​tuition​ fees​​ ​have​ been​ ​on​ ​the​ ​rise,​ ​ there​ ​has​ been​ a ​greater​ ​demand​ ​for​ ​loans.
We created this application in an effort to show just how much the need for loans to fund education in the US has risen (or dropped) over the past 10 years.

**Enjoy exploring our data!**
