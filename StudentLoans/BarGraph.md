### Background Info & Data Analysis

**Overall the cost of college is rising with the average amount of loans per person increasing each year.** Between the years 2007 and 2017 there has been an increase of 58.2% in the number of dollars owed per person. This increase is much greater than the increase of inflation, with inflation only increasing the value of the dollar 18.1%. This drastic difference of 40.1% shows the rising cost of a college education and the need for lower tuition costs. This increase in the cost of college will lead to a greater amount of loans needed to be taken out for each student. The amount of loans and money needed to go to college is becoming more and more of a barrier to pursue a college education. If the cost of tuition doesnâ€™t decrease its inflation it will lead to an even greater amount of loans per student.
